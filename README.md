# Unexpected Results in Subtraction Function

This repository demonstrates a simple JavaScript function that performs subtraction. However, it highlights a potential issue that can occur if the function is not handled properly.

## Description

The `myFunction` function takes two numbers as input and returns their difference. While seemingly straightforward, this function can produce unexpected results if the inputs are not carefully considered.

For example, if the first number is smaller than the second, the result will be negative.  This is mathematically correct, but might be unexpected in some applications.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `bug.js` file in your preferred code editor.
3. Run the code using a JavaScript interpreter (like Node.js).
4. Observe the output.  The unexpected output may highlight the need for more robust error handling or input validation.
